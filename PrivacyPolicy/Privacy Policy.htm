                        HuaheePya does not sell or otherwise share personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement.
                        <br><br>

                    <h4>Children's Privacy Notice</h4>
                    <p>
                        HuaheePya understands the importance of privacy of users of our Online Services.  We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our Online Services.  This Children's Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal information we collect through our Online Services from children under the age of 13.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i>A. What Personal Information Does HuaheePya Collect?</i></h5>
                    <p>
                        We offer many features on our Sites, like games and coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information.  On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from children as part of an activity.  For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>We may collect a child's email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition or prize draw.  In that event, we will notify the child using the email address the child supplies.  We will not keep the email address or use it for any other purpose.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time basis, such as to send the child a screen saver.  In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address for any other purpose.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13, such as a postal address or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian.  If parent or guardian consent is required, we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent's or guardian's consent.
                        <br><br>

                        HuaheePya will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i>B. How Does HuaheePya Use the Personal Information It Collects?</i></h5>
                    <p>
                        We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child's request or to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition or prize draw they entered.  We use the email address of a parent or guardian in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent's or guardian's consent.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i>C. How Does HuaheePya Share Personal Information?</i></h5>
                    <p>
                        We may share a child's personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our Online Services, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
                        <br><br>

                        We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for HuaheePya. These services may include hosting our Sites, providing technical services to HuaheePya, fulfilling requests or administering a contest, competition or prize draw.  We do not authorize such vendors to disclose the personal information we share with them other than as necessary to perform the relevant service for HuaheePya.

                    <p>
                        A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser.   Like most websites, HuaheePya uses cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience.  For example, we track the total number of visitors to our Sites on an anonymous aggregate basis.  We may also employ cookies so that we remember you when you return to the Site, to keep track of the items in your shopping cart if you purchase merchandise online, to administer certain contests and to help customize your HuaheePya web experience.   We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.   Both we and others (such as out advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities, overtime and across third-party websites, when using our Online services.

                        We may use other technologies, including web beacons and JavaScript, which sometimes work together with cookies and other means with our Sites and Mobile Apps to uniquely identify your device.  These other technologies help enable features on our Sites and within our Mobile Apps.
                        <br><br>

                        We may also use certain technologies to determine whether you have opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail.
